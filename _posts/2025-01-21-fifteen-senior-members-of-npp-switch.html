Speaking at Congress Bhavan, Supongmeren described this transition as a pivotal moment for the party, reinforcing its commitment to grassroots development and transformative change.</b></p><p><b>NPCC working president Khriedi Theiinuo expressed optimism about the new members’ contribution, emphasizing that their support would help advance the party’s mission. Among the key figures making the switch, NPP vice-president Bitong Sangtam clarified that their decision stemmed not from resentment towards NPP but from aspirations for a more progressive future. He acknowledged the challenges they faced within NPP and the need for new opportunities.</b></p><p><b>Echoing similar sentiments, NPP general secretary L Hiketo Shohe highlighted the necessity for a shift in Nagaland’s political landscape. He expressed confidence in the Congress’s vision and asserted that their move was driven by careful consideration of public interest. Although Congress currently lacks representation in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly, Hiketo remained hopeful about its prospects in the upcoming elections. He stressed the importance of a strong opposition over being part of a coalition with limited influence.</b></p><p><b><script type="text/javascript">

He argued that such restrictions projected a negative perception of the state, hindering investment and development. He assured that Congress would bring this issue to Parliament through Supongmeren Jamir, advocating for policies that foster stronger connections and economic growth.</b></p><p><b>Additionally, Supongmeren reaffirmed Congress’s stance on the removal of the Free Movement Regime (FMR), which impacts cultural and historical ties among the Naga people across the Indo-Myanmar border. He underscored that the central government recognized these concerns and acknowledged the need for more inclusive policies. With this new wave of members, Congress aims to reinvigorate its presence in Nagaland, pushing for reforms that align with the state’s aspirations. <script type="text/javascript">
