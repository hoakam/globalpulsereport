His remarks make him the first official from a Western government to publicly question the app’s data policies.</p><p>Chinese technology firms, including Huawei and TikTok, have often faced allegations regarding their links to the Chinese government, raising fears that user data might be gathered for intelligence purposes. While former U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged DeepSeek’s emergence as a significant development, he did not classify it as a national security threat. Instead, he suggested that its presence in the market could be beneficial by driving down costs.</p><p>Speaking to ABC News on Tuesday, Husic emphasized that many important questions about the chatbot remain unanswered, particularly concerning how it handles user data and privacy. He advised caution, stating that such issues must be thoroughly examined before drawing conclusions.</p><p>DeepSeek has not responded to requests for comment from the BBC, but despite official warnings, users in the United Kingdom and the United States appear to have no hesitation in embracing the app. Sensor Tower, a market analysis firm, reports that DeepSeek has already been downloaded three million times since its launch. The majority of these downloads—around 80%—have taken place in the past week, meaning its adoption rate has been three times that of competitors like Perplexity.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

It also gathers user input, including text, voice recordings, and conversation histories. Additionally, technical details such as a user’s phone model, operating system, IP address, and even typing behavior are recorded. The firm states that this data is stored securely on servers in China and is used to enhance the chatbot’s security, stability, and functionality.</p><p>Furthermore, the information collected is shared with third parties, including service providers, advertising partners, and affiliated companies. The privacy policy states that this data is retained for as long as necessary.</p><p>ExpressVPN’s digital privacy advocate, Lauren Hendry Parsons, has voiced concerns regarding the extent of data collection, particularly a clause stating that user data may be used to "help match you and your actions outside of the service." She believes this should serve as a warning sign for those who prioritize privacy.</p><p>Despite the extensive data collection, some experts argue that DeepSeek’s policies are not fundamentally different from those of other AI-powered services such as ChatGPT and Gemini, or even major social media platforms.</p><p>Emily Taylor, CEO of Oxford Information Labs, explained that any AI chatbot with a web or mobile interface, including DeepSeek, allows its developers to access the questions users ask and the responses generated. She cautioned that individuals dealing with sensitive or classified information should remain aware of these risks.</p><p>Dr. Richard Whittle from the University of Salford echoed these concerns, stating that while he has reservations about DeepSeek’s approach to data privacy, similar issues exist with AI models developed in the United States. He advised consumers to remain vigilant, especially when dealing with new, highly popular applications that generate excitement and fear of missing out.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

In response to questions from the BBC about whether it shares Australia’s concerns, the regulator stated that companies developing and deploying generative AI must provide users with clear, accessible information about how their data is used. It emphasized that it will continue to monitor compliance and take action if firms fail to meet regulatory expectations.</p>
