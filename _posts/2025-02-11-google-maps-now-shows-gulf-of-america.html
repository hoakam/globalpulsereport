The change, which appears to affect the Gulf of Mexico region, has sparked questions about its origins and potential geopolitical implications.</p><p data-end="717" data-start="409">Users first noticed the term appearing on Google Maps earlier this week, leading to speculation about whether it was an official name change, a glitch, or an intentional update by Google. Historically known as the Gulf of Mexico, this body of water borders the southeastern United States, Mexico, and Cuba.</p><p data-end="1111" data-start="719">Reactions have been swift, with social media buzzing over the unexpected name. Some users viewed it as an attempt to assert U.S. influence over the region, while others dismissed it as an error or an experiment by Google. Experts in geography and international relations have also weighed in, emphasizing that no official entity has recognized "Gulf of America" as a legitimate designation.</p><p data-end="1447" data-start="1113">Google has yet to comment on the change, leaving many wondering whether it will be corrected or remain in place. In the meantime, the appearance of "Gulf of America" on Google Maps has fueled discussions about digital cartography, political influence, and the power of technology companies in shaping public perception of geography.</p>
