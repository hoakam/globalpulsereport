The verdict, delivered on Monday, comes after the court found her guilty of poisoning the 23-year-old in an attempt to end their relationship.</div><div><script type="text/javascript">

Her marriage had already been arranged with an army officer from Tamil Nadu, leading her to take drastic measures. In 2022, she laced an ayurvedic tonic with paraquat, a highly toxic herbicide, and gave it to Raj. He suffered multiple organ failure and died 11 days later.</p><p>Officials revealed that this was not her first attempt to poison him. Earlier, she had tried mixing crushed paracetamol tablets in his fruit juice, but Raj refused to drink it due to its bitter taste. &gt;</p></div><p>During the sentencing, Greeshma pleaded for leniency, citing her academic achievements, lack of a prior criminal record, and the fact that she is her parents' only daughter. However, the court rejected these arguments, emphasizing the gravity of the crime and stating that her age was not a factor that warranted leniency.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

Following the verdict, Special Public Prosecutor VS Vineeth Kumar expressed confidence in the court’s decision, stating that this case fell under the "rarest of the rare" category and deserved capital punishment.</p><p>Sharon Raj, a BSc Radiology student from Parassala in Thiruvananthapuram district, lost his life due to Greeshma’s calculated actions. Her uncle, Nirmalakumaran Nair, was also convicted for destroying evidence, while her mother, initially taken into custody, was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. The case serves as a grim reminder of how love, betrayal, and desperation can lead to tragic consequences.</p>
