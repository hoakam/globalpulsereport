The gesture, captured in a viral video, quickly led to discussions across social media, with some users alleging it carried deeper political or ideological connotations.</p><p>Critics and conspiracy theorists speculated that Musk was signaling support for a particular movement or ideology, while his supporters argued that the reaction was overblown. Some experts in body language have weighed in, with mixed interpretations—some calling it a simple reflexive movement and others suggesting it might have been intentional.</p><p>Musk, known for his often cryptic and sometimes controversial social media presence, took to X (formerly Twitter) to address the controversy. “People are reading too much into this. Sometimes a hand gesture is just a hand gesture,” he posted, seemingly dismissing the speculation. <script type="text/javascript">

The incident adds to the long list of moments where Musk’s actions—whether online or in public appearances—have sparked debate and divided opinions.</p><p>While there is no official statement from the Trump camp regarding the matter, sources close to the former president suggest that the incident has not affected Musk’s standing within conservative circles. However, as the controversy lingers, it remains to be seen whether this will have any lasting impact on Musk’s public image or business ventures.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">
