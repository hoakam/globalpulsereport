<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/06de7730e1d363e031b408c27e40c384/invoke.js"></script></strong></div><p>Reliance Jio, India’s leading telecom operator, has rolled out new prepaid plans focused solely on voice and SMS services, in line with the recent directive from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This move suggests that tariff reductions are unlikely in the near future, as Jio makes adjustments to its offerings. The newly introduced plans comply with TRAI’s requirement for telecom providers to offer separate Special Tariff Vouchers (STVs) for voice and SMS, enabling customers to pay only for the services they need. The primary objective is to cater to specific user groups, particularly senior citizens and individuals residing in rural areas.</p><h3>New Jio Prepaid Plans</h3><h4>Jio Value Rs 458 Voice-Only Plan</h4><p>The most affordable Voice and SMS-exclusive plan from Jio is priced at Rs 458. It provides unlimited voice calls along with 1,000 SMS for a duration of 84 days. In addition, customers receive complimentary access to Jio Apps such as JioTV, JioCinema (non-premium), and JioCloud. Jio may have included these app subscriptions assuming users will access them via Wi-Fi or separate data packs. This plan is categorized under Jio’s ‘Value’ segment.</p><p>Previously, a similar plan was available for Rs 479, which included unlimited voice calls, 6GB of data (followed by unlimited data at 64 Kbps), and 1,000 SMS for the same 84-day validity. The revised plan is Rs 21 cheaper but eliminates the data benefit while maintaining voice, SMS, and app subscription features.</p><h4>Jio Value Rs 1,958 Voice-Only Plan</h4><div><script type="text/javascript">

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/06de7730e1d363e031b408c27e40c384/invoke.js"></script></div><p>Jio’s annual Voice and SMS-only plan is now priced at Rs 1,958. It provides 365 days of validity, unlimited voice calling, and 3,600 SMS. Additional perks include access to Jio Apps like JioTV, JioCinema (non-premium), and JioCloud. This plan is also categorized under Jio’s ‘Value’ offerings.</p><p>Previously, the corresponding plan was available for Rs 1,899, offering 336 days of validity, unlimited voice calls, 3,600 SMS, 6GB of data, and unlimited data at 64 Kbps after reaching the data cap. The updated version increases the price by Rs 59, removes the data benefit, and extends the validity by 29 days while retaining voice, SMS, and app access.</p><h3>Plan Revisions and Discontinuations</h3><p>Prior to these changes, Jio had three plans under its ‘Value’ category. However, with this revision, the telecom operator has reduced its offerings to two voice and SMS-only plans. The third plan, priced at Rs 189, which included unlimited voice calls, 300 SMS, and 2GB of data, has been discontinued. Customers requiring additional data can opt for Jio’s data packs to complement these new Voice and SMS plans.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">
