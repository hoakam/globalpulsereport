He also expressed his willingness to engage in discussions with the new U.S. president regarding the ongoing situation.</p><p>Trump has frequently asserted that the war in Ukraine would not have occurred under his leadership. However, this was the first instance of Putin making a similar claim while also reiterating Trump’s baseless assertion that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was fraudulent.</p><p>"I cannot disagree with Trump when he says that if he had not been denied victory in 2020, the crisis in Ukraine that unfolded in 2022 might not have happened," Putin remarked during an interview on a Russian television channel, alluding to the full-scale invasion he personally ordered in February 2022.</p><p>Trump has previously claimed that he could resolve the conflict in Ukraine within a single day but later assigned his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, a 100-day timeframe to negotiate a resolution.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

However, earlier this week, Trump mentioned that Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky had expressed interest in reaching an agreement and suggested that Putin might also be open to negotiations.</p><p>"I believe Russia should want to come to an agreement. Maybe they do. From what I hear, Putin would like to meet with me. We’ll arrange a meeting as soon as possible. I would meet immediately because every day without talks, soldiers continue to die on the battlefield," Trump told reporters on Thursday.</p><p>Putin appeared receptive to the idea, emphasizing that Russia has always remained open to dialogue.</p><p>"As for negotiations, we have repeatedly stated—and I want to stress once again—that we are prepared to discuss the Ukrainian issue," the Russian president said in the interview. The day before, the Kremlin mentioned that it was awaiting signals from Washington regarding potential discussions.</p><p>Putin’s remarks came a day after Trump issued a warning about possible new sanctions against Moscow while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

"Trump is not only an intelligent individual but also a pragmatic one. I find it difficult to believe that he would make decisions that could harm the American economy itself," Putin stated.</p><p>Later on Friday, Zelensky responded to Putin’s comments, accusing him of attempting to manipulate Trump for his own benefit.</p><p>The Ukrainian leader revealed that discussions during Ukraine’s Supreme Commander in Chief Staff meeting had addressed Russia’s military capabilities and Putin’s determination to continue the war while trying to influence global leaders.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

However, I am confident that Russian manipulation will no longer succeed," Zelensky asserted.</p><br />
