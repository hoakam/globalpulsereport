The National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning for much of the foothills and mountainous regions of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, including Malibu. These warnings indicate a heightened risk of fire due to strong winds and extremely low humidity levels. The fire-fueling conditions are expected to persist through Thursday, with some areas experiencing humidity levels as low as 2% to 5%.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

The Storm Prediction Center has classified parts of the San Gabriel Mountains and surrounding areas, including the Malibu coast, as an “extremely critical” fire zone. Winds are expected to peak Monday afternoon and evening, continuing into early Tuesday, with this Santa Ana wind event potentially lasting through midweek. Northeast winds will strengthen Monday night, reaching speeds between 35 and 50 mph in the mountains and foothills, while widespread gusts could range from 60 to 80 mph. Some areas, such as the San Gabriels and Santa Susanas, may see isolated gusts reaching 100 mph. Coastal and valley regions will experience winds between 25 and 40 mph, with peak gusts between 50 and 70 mph.</p><p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced the deployment of more than 130 fire engines, water tenders, and aircraft to Southern California. Adding to the challenges, nearly all of Southern California is experiencing severe drought conditions, and no rain is forecasted for the week. Downtown Los Angeles has received just 0.16 inches of rain since October 1, while Los Angeles International Airport has recorded a mere 0.03 inches. This marks the driest start to a year on record for the region. The US Drought Monitor reports that 90% of Los Angeles County is now classified under severe drought, a sharp increase from the previous month when no such conditions were recorded. <script type="text/javascript">

Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire, which has scorched 14,021 acres, is at 81% containment. These fires have led to devastating consequences, with at least 27 people confirmed dead and thousands of homes destroyed. As of Saturday, approximately 41,000 people remained under evacuation orders or warnings in Los Angeles County. While some areas, such as parts of Altadena, have been reopened to residents, many others remain restricted. Fire officials estimate that it will take at least another week before it is safe for residents to return to their homes and assess the damage.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="183" data-original-width="275" height="235" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZKeKLY6uVQym90t0zI0ggVwl7HSzX-l8WnvvwiIMUeaSJoz1CZopDV9f8Q0kly99IRDJQTg0VOMpRPZPgemjVphVh25EJOoYC1JYIfMOIYYXD65ilRDDb5-BORm7H35X5E3f9yhTTPZHkZW_NZd1tzpgxkW9vqyWLKOJ3qejru8yyOmTt79eEQLh_c_Ta/w354-h235/images.jpeg" width="354" /></div>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has already distributed more than $32 million in aid to wildfire survivors. Meanwhile, Pasadena has announced red flag parking restrictions starting Monday to facilitate emergency access and evacuations in high-risk areas. City officials emphasize that their goal is to ensure residents are prepared for worsening conditions. In addition to the fire risk, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has issued an advisory warning residents of windblown dust and ash, which pose health risks.<p></p><p>Concerns have been raised about the preparedness of the Los Angeles Fire Department in handling the ongoing wildfire crisis. Two years ago, Fire Chief Kristin Crowley warned city leaders that the absence of a regularly staffed wildland hand crew could lead to containment issues. The city relies on a part-time, volunteer hand crew, mostly made up of teenagers, who use basic tools like axes and shovels to combat wildfires. When the Palisades Fire broke out on January 7, no professional Los Angeles Fire Department unit was available for an immediate response, leaving crews from Los Angeles County and the state to take initial action.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

However, a spokesperson for the mayor’s office emphasized that funding for wildland hand crews has since been quadrupled, with efforts accelerating in response to worsening climate conditions. A CNN analysis of fire department staffing in the ten largest US cities indicates that the Los Angeles Fire Department is among the least staffed, raising further concerns about the city’s ability to respond effectively to large-scale wildfire events.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div>
