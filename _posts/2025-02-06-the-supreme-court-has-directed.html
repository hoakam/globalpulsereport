The plea highlighted that following the release of the documentary <em>Cult of Fear: Asaram Bapu</em>, the channel and its associates faced several hate comments and threats on social media.</p><p>Senior Advocate Abhinav Mukherji, representing the petitioners, argued that the threats had made it increasingly difficult for the Discovery officials to travel freely across the country. He stated, "The police have done nothing; we went home and asked employees not to come to work. We’ve now received a letter threatening us with a mass agitation. There’s a 2018 guideline that Lordships have laid down," referring to an existing safety protocol.</p><p>The Supreme Court bench issued an order directing the authorities to provide necessary protection, stating, "Issue notice returnable in the week commencing March 3, 2025. In the meantime, we request the police to ensure the petitioners can use their office without fear of physical harm."</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

The petitioners argued that the documentary, which was based on public records, court rulings, and witness testimonies, was made with journalistic integrity.</p><p>The petitioners also recounted an incident on January 30, when a mob gathered outside their Mumbai office, causing a disturbance. Although the police dispersed the crowd, no action was taken against the individuals responsible.&nbsp;</p><p><script type="text/javascript">
