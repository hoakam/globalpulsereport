England, after being put to bat, has struggled against India’s disciplined bowling attack, losing crucial wickets at regular intervals.</p><h3><strong>Varun Chakravarthy Strikes Big</strong></h3><p>Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy has made an impact, dismissing Liam Livingstone, one of England’s most explosive batters. Livingstone, who was looking to accelerate the scoring rate, was undone by Chakravarthy’s sharp spin, adding to England’s troubles. With his dismissal, England finds itself at 75/4, putting India in a strong position.</p><h3><strong>England’s Early Wicket Woes</strong></h3><p>England’s innings started with a steady yet cautious approach. However, Indian bowlers struck early to remove key batters, pushing the visitors on the back foot. With power-hitters like Jos Buttler and Phil Salt back in the pavilion, England has been forced to rebuild their innings in the middle overs.</p><h3><strong>Indian Bowlers in Command</strong></h3><div><strong><script type="text/javascript">

Arshdeep Singh and Axar Patel have bowled with precision, ensuring England doesn’t get easy runs. The spinners have played a key role in containing the English batters, who are finding it difficult to settle in the conditions.</p><h3><strong>What’s Next in the Match?</strong></h3><p>England still has some firepower in the form of Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali, who will be crucial in setting up a competitive total. However, with India’s bowlers maintaining their grip on the game, the visitors will have to bat smartly to post a defendable score.</p><p>With the game hanging in balance, stay tuned for more updates as the action unfolds in Kolkata!</p>
