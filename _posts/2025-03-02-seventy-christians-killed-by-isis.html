The attack, suspected to have been orchestrated by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a group affiliated with the Islamic State, took place in the village of Mayba before culminating in a mass killing inside a church in Kasanga.</p><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-normal break-words text-start [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="4db09d48-6a63-4358-a300-9501898b63d8" data-message-model-slug="gpt-4o" dir="auto"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p data-end="822" data-start="393">The violence began in the early hours of the morning when militants raided homes, ordering residents to come outside while warning them to remain silent. They abducted 20 Christians, tying them up and leading them away. As the community realized what had happened, villagers gathered in an attempt to organize a response. However, before they could act, more militants surrounded the village, capturing an additional 50 people.</p><p data-end="1283" data-start="824">The abducted Christians were forcibly taken to a Protestant church where the militants executed them using machetes and hammers. The scene of the massacre was horrifying, leaving the region in a state of shock and mourning. Days after the attack, many families were still unable to bury their loved ones due to the ongoing security risks in the area. Fearing for their lives, many residents fled to safer regions, leaving behind their homes and livelihoods.</p><p data-end="1283" data-start="824"><script type="text/javascript">

Over the years, the group has been responsible for the displacement and killing of thousands, the destruction of homes, schools, churches, and health facilities, and the forced abandonment of entire villages.</p><p data-end="2094" data-start="1648">International organizations and human rights advocates have condemned the attack, calling for urgent intervention to protect civilians. Open Doors, a global Christian advocacy group, emphasized the need for immediate action from governments and international bodies to end the cycle of violence. The organization highlighted the impunity with which groups like the ADF operate, urging authorities to ensure accountability for those responsible.</p><p data-end="2448" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2096">Church leaders and Christian communities across the region are struggling to cope with the trauma and loss. Despite the despair, calls for prayer and support continue, with many hoping for peace and protection amid the ongoing conflict. As the situation remains dire, the need for international attention and decisive action has never been more urgent.</p><p data-end="2448" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2096"><script type="text/javascript">
