The document included references to alt-right ideology, explicit praise for Adolf Hitler, and statements against racial integration. It also contained violent rhetoric expressing a desire for revenge against society, as well as images from past school shootings, according to MNPD Chief John Drake.</p><p>Authorities linked the shooter to various social media accounts across multiple platforms, including X, Kick, and TikTok. These accounts reportedly contained extremist and misogynistic content associated with white nationalist and "incel" communities.</p><p>The document, last updated four hours before the attack, indicated that the shooter originally planned to carry out the attack on Thursday. It also mentioned an intent to kill at least ten people, including a specific elementary school teacher who was not named.</p><h3>Community Gathers for Vigil</h3><p>In response to the tragedy, community members, students, and faith leaders assembled Wednesday night at Hamilton United Methodist Church in Antioch. The vigil was interfaith and multilingual, bringing together a diverse group of attendees seeking comfort and solidarity.</p><p>Among the speakers were Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, Metro Nashville Councilmembers Delishia Porterfield, Deonté Harrell, and Zulfat Suara. Clergy members, including Revs. Quentin Dickerson, Mamdouh Ramzy, Rachel Booker, and Imam Moaz Roaf from the Islamic Center of Tennessee, also shared words of encouragement.</p><p>Aaron Rodriguez, a teacher at Antioch High School, moved many attendees to tears with his speech.

A 17-year-old male student who was wounded has since been treated and released from Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p><p>MNPD has not yet found any clear connections between Henderson and the students who were shot, and investigators believe they may have been struck at random inside the cafeteria.</p><p>At the time of the attack, two school resource officers were present on campus but were in a different area of the building. By the time they arrived at the scene, Henderson had already turned the gun on himself.</p><p>Detectives are reviewing Henderson’s online posts and writings in collaboration with state and federal agencies. Authorities have not disclosed whether Henderson had any prior interactions with law enforcement.</p><h3>Shooter Livestreamed Part of the Attack</h3><p>Kick, a live-streaming platform, confirmed that Henderson broadcasted part of the shooting on his account. In a statement posted on X, the company said, “KICK rapidly banned the account and removed the video. Violence has no place on KICK. We are actively working with law enforcement and taking all appropriate steps to support their investigation.”</p><p>Some video clips circulating online show Henderson filming himself walking through school hallways and attempting to enter locked classrooms.</p><h3>Gun Safety Concerns Raised</h3><p>Dr. Jonathan Metzl, a sociology professor at Vanderbilt University and director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society, expressed concern over Tennessee’s ongoing refusal to implement stricter gun laws.</p><p>“We continue to see these tragedies in places where people should feel safe—schools, restaurants, and other public spaces,” Metzl said. “We need to learn from these incidents and implement policies that both protect the rights of gun owners and make schools safer.”</p><p>Metzl, author of <em>What We’ve Become: Living and Dying in a Country of Arms</em>, has previously proposed measures such as "red flag" laws and expanded background checks, but these initiatives have not gained traction in Tennessee’s legislature.</p><h3>Antioch High School Closes for the Week</h3><p>Metro Nashville Public Schools Director Adrienne Battle announced that Antioch High School will remain closed for the rest of the week to allow students and staff time to process the tragedy.</p><p>MNPS is arranging counseling services for students and faculty, though specific details on the location and availability of these resources have yet to be provided.</p><h3>MNPD Chief: Online Materials Being Reviewed</h3><p>During a news conference Wednesday afternoon, MNPD Chief John Drake confirmed that online materials connected to the shooter are playing a significant role in the ongoing investigation.</p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Authorities are still working to determine the shooter's motive, according to Chief John Drake.</p><p>"We're investigating that aspect," Drake stated. "There are online materials we're reviewing as part of the case."</p><p>He later emphasized the importance of vigilance in preventing such incidents.</p><p>"We suspect that some concerning materials were available, and perhaps they were noticed," Drake said. "If someone had spoken up, maybe this could have been prevented."</p><h3>Metro Nashville Police Identify Victim and Shooter</h3><p>Metro Nashville Police identified the victim who lost her life as 16-year-old Josselin Corea Escalante and the shooter as 17-year-old Solomon Henderson. The department shared the information on X, formerly Twitter, around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p><h3>Students and Parents Recall the Tragic Day</h3><div><script type="text/javascript">

The motive remains unknown, and the investigation is expected to continue into the early morning hours.</p><h3>Students Recall Moments of Fear</h3><p>Tinashae Smith, a ninth-grader, described the terrifying experience of hiding in her classroom. When she saw people running in the hallways, she alerted her teacher, who tried calling the administration but received no response.</p><p>After checking their phones, students discovered that a shooting had taken place. A lockdown was initiated, and they barricaded the door with desks and chairs.</p><p>"I was scared and confused," Smith said. "Everything happened so fast."</p><p>At around 2 p.m., she was finally able to reunite with her sister. "I never want to go through something like this again," she said.</p><h3>Transportation and Reunification Efforts</h3><p>Metro Schools provided updates on student transportation.
