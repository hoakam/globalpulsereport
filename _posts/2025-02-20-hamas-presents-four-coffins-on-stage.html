The event, held at a former cemetery, saw four black coffins placed on a stage, each adorned with photos of the deceased. Behind them, a large banner depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a blood-stained vampire, adding to the provocative nature of the scene.</p><p>The bodies, identified as Shiri Bibas, her two sons Kfir and Ariel, and 83-year-old Oded Lifshitz, were handed over under the fragile ceasefire currently in place between Israel and Hamas. The transfer marked the first return of hostages' bodies by Hamas since the war began following its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

White mock-up missiles inscribed with "They were killed by USA bombs" were positioned nearby, underscoring Hamas's message. A Red Cross official finalized paperwork with a militant before the bodies were transported in Red Cross vehicles.</p><p>Israel’s military later confirmed that the remains had been received and were undergoing identification. However, in a shocking turn of events, Israeli authorities found that one of the bodies was not that of Shiri Bibas, leading to urgent demands for Hamas to return her remains.</p><p>The Bibas family had become emblematic of Israel’s anguish over the hostage crisis. Footage of their abduction, showing Shiri and her young sons being taken from their home near the Gaza border, had gripped the nation. The family’s father, Yarden Bibas, had been captured separately and was released earlier this month in a previous hostage-prisoner exchange.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the day as "heartbreaking" for Israel, calling Hamas’s display an act of cruelty. International condemnation followed swiftly, with the United Nations’ human rights chief branding the event "abhorrent" and a violation of the dignity of the deceased and their families.</p><p>The repatriation of the bodies comes as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19, following months of intense fighting. As part of the deal, 19 Israeli hostages have so far been exchanged for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners. Despite this, tensions remain high, and questions persist over the fate of the remaining hostages in Gaza.</p><p>In a further development, Hamas and Israel have agreed to the return of the remains of eight more hostages in two separate phases, alongside the scheduled release of six living Israeli captives this coming weekend. However, Hamas has suggested that all remaining hostages could be exchanged in a single deal during the ceasefire’s second phase, though the exact number of captives still in Gaza remains unclear.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

While diplomatic efforts persist, the emotional toll on both Israelis and Palestinians remains profound, with no clear resolution in sight.</p>
