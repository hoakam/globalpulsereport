The exams will be conducted from January 22 to January 30 in two shifts, with the morning session from 9 AM to 12 noon and the second shift scheduled for 3 PM onwards. Paper 2, which includes BArch and BPlanning, will take place exclusively on January 30 in the second shift. The duration of Paper 1 (BE/BTech), Paper 2A (BArch), and Paper 2B (BPlanning) is three hours, while candidates appearing for both BArch and BPlanning papers together will have three hours and 30 minutes.</p><p>JEE Main 2025 is being conducted in two phases this year, with the second session scheduled for April. Candidates must undergo frisking and biometric attendance verification, including after toilet breaks. Registration was required through DigiLocker or ABC ID, and those who opted for non-Aadhaar authentication or did not complete the DigiLocker/ABC ID registration must report earlier on the exam day for biometric verification. All candidates must reach the exam center at least an hour before the scheduled time to ensure a smooth entry process.</p><p>On the exam day, candidates must carry a printed copy of their JEE Main 2025 admit card along with an original photo identity proof. A passport-size photograph, identical to the one uploaded with the online application, must be pasted on the admit card. It is advisable to bring two additional copies of the photograph for convenience. Another passport-size photograph will be required for the attendance sheet.</p><p>Several items are strictly prohibited inside the examination center, including geometry boxes, pencil cases, handbags, purses, papers, stationery, textual material, eatables, water bottles, mobile phones, earphones, microphones, pagers, calculators, docupens, slide rules, log tables, cameras, tape recorders, metallic items, and any electronic gadgets or devices.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

Shoes with thick soles are not permitted, and simple, comfortable clothing is recommended. Scarves should also be avoided.</p><p>For Paper 2, candidates appearing for the drawing test must bring their own geometry box set, pencils, erasers, and either color pencils or crayons, as watercolors are not allowed on the drawing sheet. Diabetic students are permitted to carry essential eatables such as sugar tablets and fruits like bananas, apples, or oranges, along with a transparent water bottle. However, packaged food items such as chocolates, candy, or sandwiches are not allowed.</p><p>Before leaving the examination hall, candidates must drop their JEE Main admit card in the designated drop box. The National Testing Agency (NTA) has stated that failure to submit the admit card will result in the candidateâ€™s answers not being evaluated.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">
