Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a location he chose to honor President Abraham Lincoln, whom he described as "a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today." Today, millions honor King in a similar way.</b></p><p><b>Each year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed on the third Monday of January, close to his January 15 birthday. Federal, state, and local governments, along with various institutions and industries, recognize the holiday. While some see the day as time off from work or school, King’s family and those dedicated to his legacy of equality, justice, and non-violent protest emphasize that the holiday is meant to be a time for service and helping others.</b></p><p><b>Although now a widely accepted tradition, the holiday faced significant resistance before its official establishment. The idea of a national holiday to honor King emerged in the aftermath of his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. Four days later, U.S. Democratic Representative John Conyers of Michigan, a long-serving congressman known for his advocacy for civil rights, proposed legislation to recognize King.</b></p><p><b><script type="text/javascript">

King was a polarizing figure during his lifetime. Many Americans, influenced by his speeches on poverty, housing, and opposition to the Vietnam War, viewed him as too radical. Polls from the Washington Post and the New York Times indicated widespread distrust of him, with some believing his work should have ended after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965.</b></p><p><b>For the next 15 years, the Congressional Black Caucus, founded by Conyers, pushed for the legislation. Opponents cited various reasons, including the claim that public holidays should not honor private citizens. Others falsely labeled King a communist or criticized his personal life. Meanwhile, Coretta Scott King persistently lobbied for the holiday, and musician Stevie Wonder contributed to the movement with his song "Happy Birthday" to rally support.</b></p><p><b>By the 1980s, shifts in American society made it more receptive to honoring King. Public sentiment had changed, and there was growing regret over the Vietnam War. Momentum for the holiday increased. In 1983, 20 years after King’s famous speech, Congress passed the legislation, and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law.</b></p><p><b>Despite federal recognition, not all states immediately observed the holiday. Many, particularly in the South, resisted. Arizona became a focal point of controversy when Governor Evan Mecham rescinded the holiday in 1987, saying that Black people needed jobs, not a holiday. His decision sparked protests led by figures such as Dr. Warren H. Stewart Sr., and major entertainers canceled events in Arizona. Businesses withdrew conventions, and when the state lost the opportunity to host the Super Bowl, public pressure mounted. In 1992, Arizona voters reinstated the holiday through a ballot initiative.</b></p><p><b>Elsewhere, states gradually followed suit. South Carolina was the last to fully recognize the holiday in 2000, though it did so alongside Confederate Memorial Day, a decision that disappointed many civil rights activists.</b></p><p><b><script type="text/javascript">

Unlike other federal holidays, it encourages participation rather than just observance. In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed legislation introduced by Congressman John Lewis and Senator Harris Wofford, designating it as a National Day of Service.</b></p><p><b>Cities and communities across the country now celebrate with parades, street festivals, and concerts, while service projects include community clean-ups, food donations, and blood drives. AmeriCorps, a federal agency supporting volunteer efforts, has distributed millions in grants to nonprofits and faith-based organizations, leading to thousands of service initiatives engaging hundreds of thousands of people each year. The holiday’s impact continues to grow, inspiring acts of service beyond just one day.</b></p><p><b>Rev. Bernice King, CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, hopes people go beyond quoting her father and instead commit to embodying his principles of nonviolence and justice daily. Scholars, including Lerone Martin of Stanford University’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, stress the importance of studying King’s writings, such as his 1963 "Letter from Birmingham Jail."</b></p><p><b>By understanding and internalizing his ideals, people can continue a dialogue with King—not just on one day but throughout the year.</b></p><p><script type="text/javascript">
