Three years later, in 2023, the spacecraft delivered the rock and dust specimens back to Earth, where they landed in a specially designed container using a parachute. NASA researchers then recovered the samples from a site in Utah.</p><p>Following its successful mission at Bennu, OSIRIS-REx is now traveling toward another asteroid, Apophis, which it is expected to reach in 2029.</p><p>The total material collected from Bennu weighed approximately 122 grams, making it the largest asteroid sample ever obtained from beyond the Moon. NASA has distributed portions of the sample to international research teams for further study.</p><p>Last week, two independent research teams published studies detailing their findings from the asteroid material.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

Organic compounds consist of carbon atoms bonded to elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Since all known life on Earth is based on carbon and organic molecules, these findings suggest that such building blocks may have existed in space.</p><p>The second study, published in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>, provided evidence that Bennu originated from a larger celestial body that once contained salty liquid water.</p><p>According to researchers, this discovery supports the idea that asteroids like Bennu could have played a role in distributing water and life-essential chemicals throughout the early solar system, potentially reaching other planets and moons.</p><p>Scientists emphasized the significance of working with pristine samples taken directly from the asteroid. Unlike meteorites, which are asteroid fragments that fall to Earth and can undergo chemical changes, these samples remained unaltered.</p><p>NASA stated that while the findings do not confirm the existence of life, they do suggest that conditions necessary for life may have been widespread across the early solar system. This, in turn, raises the possibility that life could have developed on other planets or moons.</p><p>Bennu is believed to have originated from a much larger icy celestial body that measured around 100 kilometers in diameter. Scientists theorize that this parent body formed in the outer solar system before being destroyed, possibly one to two billion years ago. The debris from that event likely formed Bennu and other asteroids made of loose material rather than solid rock.</p><p>Nicky Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, praised the OSIRIS-REx mission for expanding scientific knowledge about the solar system’s formation. She remarked that the mission is "already rewriting the textbook" on the subject and expressed hope that the samples will help scientists uncover which fundamental ingredients existed in the solar system before life emerged on Earth.</p><p>Tim McCoy, a Smithsonian Institution researcher and lead author of the&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;study, explained that the samples may offer insight into the type of environment that could have facilitated the transition from chemical elements to life. He suggested that the combination of organic compounds and sodium-rich water could be a critical step in the process leading to life. The research indicates that these chemical interactions might have taken place much earlier and were more widespread than previously thought.</p><p>Yasuhito Sekine, a scientist from the Institute of Science in Tokyo who was not directly involved in the study, emphasized that these discoveries were only possible due to the careful collection and preservation of asteroid material.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

He explained that the asteroid material provides new insight into a solar system that may have possessed the necessary ingredients to support life. However, he acknowledged that a major unanswered question remains: "Why, so far, do we only see life on Earth and nowhere else?"</p></div></div></div></div></div>
