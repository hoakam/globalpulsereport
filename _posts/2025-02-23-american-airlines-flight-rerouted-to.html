Kennedy International Airport with a scheduled destination of Indira Gandhi International Airport, was redirected to Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport following a potential security concern. After a thorough assessment, authorities determined that the threat was not credible. As part of standard security procedures at Indira Gandhi International Airport, a precautionary inspection was required before the aircraft could continue its journey.</p><p>Reports suggest the bomb threat was communicated via email. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) stated that the flight crew swiftly reported the security concern, prompting the necessary response measures.</p><p>"Ensuring the safety and security of our passengers and crew is our top priority, and we regret any inconvenience this may have caused," American Airlines said in its statement.</p><p>Around 2:00 p.m. local time, the flight made a formal request for diversion to Rome, as confirmed by Roberto Rao, a spokesperson for Leonardo da Vinci International Airport.</p><p>“We promptly approved the request and arranged for a secure landing,” Rao told NBC News. “Although we were not given specific details about the security threat, it was considered serious enough to necessitate a diversion, but not an immediate emergency, as the alert was received while the aircraft was over the Caspian Sea, approximately three hours from Rome.”</p><p><script type="text/javascript">
