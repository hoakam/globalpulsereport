This marks the first major holy bathing event following the tragic stampede that occurred on the last significant bathing day, which resulted in the deaths of at least 30 people. To prevent any untoward incidents, authorities have intensified security measures and established a structured bathing sequence for various spiritual sects at the Sangam Nose—the site of last week’s fatal crowd surge.</p><h3>Key Highlights of the Amrit Snan</h3><p>The event marks the third 'Amrit Snan' of the ongoing Kumbh Mela. Before sunrise, numerous saints and seers from different ‘akharas’ participated in the sacred ritual by immersing themselves in the holy waters. By 4 AM, an estimated 16.58 lakh devotees had already taken the dip, and the Uttar Pradesh government anticipates that the total number of pilgrims bathing on Monday could reach 5 crore.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Significance of Basant Panchami</strong>: This Hindu festival, observed on the first day of spring, falls on the fifth day of the Magha month. It also marks the beginning of Holi preparations and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Saraswati.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stampede Tragedy at the Previous Amrit Snan</strong>: The last major bathing event, held on Mauni Amavasya, witnessed a tragic stampede that claimed 30 lives and left 60 others injured. In response to this unfortunate incident, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been personally overseeing the preparations since Saturday.</p></li><li><p><script type="text/javascript">
