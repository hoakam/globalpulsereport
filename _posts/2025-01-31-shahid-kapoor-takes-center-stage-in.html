<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/06de7730e1d363e031b408c27e40c384/invoke.js"></script><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div></span>&nbsp;New Delhi: Shahid Kapoor delivers a power-packed performance in <em>Deva</em>, anchoring this well-crafted thriller with remarkable ease. The film, a reimagining of the 2013 Malayalam hit <em>Mumbai Police</em>, takes significant creative liberties with its screenplay, making effective modifications to the original narrative.</div><p>Director Rosshan Andrrews, marking his Hindi film debut, adapts his own Malayalam project by tailoring it to suit Shahid Kapoor’s persona. The original version, led by Prithviraj Sukumaran, had its own strengths, but <em>Deva</em> introduces a generous mix of commercial elements, enhancing the classic good cop-bad cop mystery with a fresh perspective.</p><p>The movie delves into the psyche of a hardened Mumbai police officer, scarred both physically and emotionally, who prefers using brute force rather than words. A sudden twist of fate erases his memory, leaving him with only his ingrained reflexes to rely on. Despite his mind being clouded, his instincts remain razor-sharp, helping him navigate a world filled with adversaries within and outside the force. The more he is pushed into a corner, the more he seems to thrive in the chaos.</p><p>The narrative follows Dev Ambre (Shahid Kapoor), a tough cop who, after suffering a serious head injury, finds himself struggling with amnesia. As he battles to regain his memories, he also attempts to piece together a complex case that has spiraled out of control. The film seamlessly blends different action genres, ranging from raw, high-octane sequences to intense psychological drama, striking a balance between procedural elements and unpredictable twists.</p><p>What sets <em>Deva</em> apart? While the film doesn’t shy away from familiar tropes, it manages to keep the audience engaged throughout its 157-minute runtime. A combination of gripping storytelling, compelling performances, and technical finesse ensures that the film never feels tedious, even as it stretches beyond the typical duration for an action thriller.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/06de7730e1d363e031b408c27e40c384/invoke.js"></script></p><p>The movie benefits from an impressive mix of cinematography by Amit Roy, crisp editing by A. Sreekar Prasad, and a pulsating background score by Jakes Bejoy. Together, these elements maintain the film’s energy, even during moments where the pacing deliberately slows down to build tension.</p><p>The story kicks off with a dramatic motorcycle accident that leaves Dev with memory loss. As he struggles to recover, a neurologist advises him to return to duty, hoping that immersing himself in work will help him recall lost details. As he starts retracing his steps, fragments of his past begin to surface, revealing the reasons behind his internal turmoil, moral conflicts, and the demons he must face.</p><p>The film effectively contrasts two versions of Dev Ambre—his past self, before the accident, and the present one, grappling with identity and purpose. It is up to his post-accident persona to regain control of the case and redeem the reputation of the man he once was.</p><p>Dev finds solace in his close allies. His superior officer, Farhan Khan (Pravesh Rana), is also his brother-in-law, which adds an interesting dynamic to their relationship. The film uses a wedding sequence to justify its only song-and-dance number—an awkward inclusion that feels at odds with the otherwise intense storyline.</p><p>Another key figure in Dev’s life is his longtime friend and fellow officer, Rohan D'Silva (Pavail Gulati). Their deep-rooted bond is highlighted by a significant event in the first half that serves as a pivotal moment in the plot. This friendship plays a crucial role in Dev’s journey, shaping his actions as he attempts to make sense of his fractured memories.</p><p>Amnesia as a plot device is nothing new in cinema, but <em>Deva</em> employs it as a turning point in the protagonist’s relationship with his profession and those around him. One such connection is with Diya Sathe (Pooja Hegde), an investigative journalist and daughter of a police constable. While she initially assists Dev in his case, her role ultimately leans more towards being a romantic interest. However, as the film progresses, even that subplot takes a backseat, with no additional love songs to emphasize their chemistry beyond the wedding sequence.</p><p>Another underutilized character is Deepti Singh (Kubbra Sait), a police officer involved in operations against criminals. While Dev’s past self largely ignores her, his post-accident version recognizes her value and includes her in his plans. Unfortunately, the film’s male-dominated world offers little room for her to leave a lasting impact.</p><p>Dev is a force to be reckoned with—a cop who operates on his own terms, often crossing the line in his pursuit of justice. Whether facing off against a gangster-turned-politician (played by Girish Kulkarni in a brief role) or taking down criminals in brutal encounters, his impulsive nature lands him in trouble. A courtroom scene reveals that he has multiple cases filed against him, making it difficult for his superiors to control him.</p><p>While many such rebellious cop characters have graced the screen before, Dev Ambre manages to stand apart. He isn’t just a reckless officer seeking redemption—he is a man battling his own fragmented reality, adding depth to his persona.</p><p><script type="text/javascript">

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.highperformanceformat.com/06de7730e1d363e031b408c27e40c384/invoke.js"></script></p><p>A key moment arises when Farhan helps Dev reconnect the dots, yet he inexplicably possesses knowledge about a crucial event that he logically shouldn’t be aware of. This detail, which revolves around a high-stakes police encounter, becomes the linchpin of the story’s progression. While this inconsistency stands out, it is one of the few lapses in an otherwise well-executed narrative.</p><p>Fortunately, such inconsistencies are exceptions rather than the norm in <em>Deva</em>. The modifications to the original plot provide an engaging build-up to the climax, ensuring that even viewers familiar with <em>Mumbai Police</em> remain intrigued. The film keeps its audience guessing, offering fresh surprises despite its source material’s well-known storyline.</p><p>At its core, <em>Deva</em> is a Shahid Kapoor showcase, but it isn’t just a film for his fans. It is an action-packed thriller that delivers entertainment while keeping viewers invested till the very end.</p>
